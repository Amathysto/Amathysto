### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Amethy, or you can refer to me as Amathyst, or 4m47hy57, Amy, whatever the hell you want I suppose.

I learn code in my free time as I really don't have anything better to do, that and its pretty cool to learn.
The way I learn is by reverse engineering other bits of code on the internet that is publically available. I find this the easiest way to learn code, speaking personally of course.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I am currently in the process of learning :

### HTML, CSS, JavaScript, C#, Python, Lua and Batch.

If you're willing to help me learn, you can contact me via :

**Discord : Amathyst#9293**

**Email : 4m47hy57@gmail.com**

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you're really curious what I'm interested in codewise, I'm interested in stuff like :

https://github.com/CorentinJ/Real-Time-Voice-Cloning

https://github.com/HyperGAN/HyperGAN

https://github.com/tsurumeso/vocal-remover

Basically, just AI/ Neural Networking stuff.
