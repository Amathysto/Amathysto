### Hello there.

My name is Amethy.

I learn code in my free time as I really don't have anything better to do, that and its pretty cool to learn.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I am currently in the process of learning :

### HTML, CSS, JavaScript, C#, Python, Lua, Batch, SQL And PHP

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you're willing to help me learn or you want to just know me, you can contact me via :

**Discord : Amathyst#9293**

**Email : 4m47hy57@gmail.com**

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you're really curious what I'm interested in codewise, I'm interested in stuff like :

https://github.com/CorentinJ/Real-Time-Voice-Cloning

https://github.com/HyperGAN/HyperGAN

https://github.com/tsurumeso/vocal-remover

Basically, just AI/ Neural Networking stuff.

Right now, my projects consist of :

My website - www.crystalsquad.org

MonkBot - A discordpy based discord bot.

MonkBot 2 - discord.js based discord bot.
