### Hello there.

My name is Amethy, or you can refer to me as Amathyst, or 4m47hy57, Amy, whatever the hell you want I suppose.

I learn code in my free time as I really don't have anything better to do, that and its pretty cool to learn.
The way I learn is by reverse engineering other bits of code on the internet that is publically available. I find this the easiest way to learn code, speaking personally of course.

- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: Call me anything you want, I don't care. I am a He/Him though.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I went camping one time with my friends and ended up exploding a can of beans into my face.

I am now afraid of bean cans.

I am currently in the process of learning :

### HTML, CSS, JavaScript, C#, Python, Lua, Batch, SQL And PHP

- I am also in the process of learning how to use Penetration testing tools.
Ethical hacking is very much appealing and I thought it would be cool to learn.

If you're really curious what I'm interested in codewise, I'm interested in stuff like :

https://github.com/CorentinJ/Real-Time-Voice-Cloning

https://github.com/HyperGAN/HyperGAN

https://github.com/tsurumeso/vocal-remover

Basically, just AI/ Neural Networking stuff.

My website - www.crystalsquad.org
MonkBot - A discordpy based discord bot.
MelonLoader Mods - A mod loader for Unity games.
